# Stress Level Detection After Sleep Using Supervised Machine Learning
This project implements and analyzes the performance of several supervised machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, random forest, KNN, SVM, and AdaBoost) to predict the stress levels of a person based on various sleep factors captured in the Smart-Yoga Pillow (SaYoPillow) dataset.
